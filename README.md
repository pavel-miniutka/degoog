Search aggregator that queries multiple engines and shows results in one place. You can add custom search engines, bang-command plugins, and slot plugins (query-triggered panels above/below results or in the sidebar). News search uses configurable RSS feeds. The dream would be to eventually have a user made marketplace for plugins/engines.

**Still in beta.** Not intended for production use yet.

## Little shoutout

This project would have never existed if the amazing [searxng](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) developers hadn't had the idea first. This is my take on a heavily customisable search aggregrator, it's meant to be a more modular lighter alternative, you can add as much as you want to it, but the core will stay as simple as it gets.
