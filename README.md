Search aggregator that queries multiple engines and shows results in one place. You can add custom search engines, bang-command plugins, and slot plugins (query-triggered panels above/below results or in the sidebar). The dream would be to eventually have a user made marketplace for plugins/engines.

**Still in beta.** Not intended for production use yet.

## Public instances

Some amazing people around the web decided to make their degoog instances available for everyone to use, and they 100% deserve a shout-out! Check out the full list [here](docs/repo/PUBLIC_INSTANCES.md)

## Store repositories

Aside from the official store these are third party repositories, they have been vetted once before adding them to the readme but I will not personally keep an eye on all of them, it's your responsibility to make sure what you install on your instance. I love open source and I'll obviously try to add these for as long as it's manageable to do so, eventually I may need a system for it, but for now they're comfy in the readme.

## Little shoutout

This project would have never existed if the amazing [searxng](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) developers hadn't had the idea first. This is my take on a heavily customisable search aggregrator, it's meant to be a more modular lighter alternative, you can add as much as you want to it, but the core will stay as simple as it gets.
