Search aggregator that queries multiple engines and shows results in one place. You can add custom search engines, bang-command plugins, and slot plugins (query-triggered panels above/below results or in the sidebar). The dream would be to eventually have a user made marketplace for plugins/engines.

**Still in beta.** Not intended for production use yet.

## Public instances

Some amazing people around the web decided to make their degoog instances available for everyone to use, and they 100% deserve a shout-out! Check out the full list [here](docs/repo/PUBLIC_INSTANCES.md)

## Store repositories

Aside from the official store these are third party repositories, they have been vetted once before adding them to the readme but I will not personally keep an eye on all of them, it's your responsibility to make sure what you install on your instance. I love open source and I'll obviously try to add these for as long as it's manageable to do so, eventually I may need a system for it, but for now they're comfy in the readme.

## Little shoutout

This project would have never existed if the amazing [searxng](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) developers hadn't had the idea first. This is my take on a heavily customisable search aggregrator, it's meant to be a more modular lighter alternative, you can add as much as you want to it, but the core will stay as simple as it gets.

Alternatives are what make the internet a fun place, let me share a few other aggregators you may want to try out, the beauty of open source is that there's no competition (or at least there shouldn't be, none of us do this shit for money after all).
